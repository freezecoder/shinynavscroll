# shinynavscroll

Introduction
=============

The scrolling Nav feature is pretty neat and uses Bootstrap to animate long scrollable pages. This small bit of shiny code shows how to enable this for shiny apps.

In ui.R source the ```scrolling_nav.R``` file, include the tags and then add your content into sections. 

 

Instructions
------------
Create your content as separate UI elements and add them to the scrollable_navmenu(). Each section menu name must match each nav_conent_section() name.
